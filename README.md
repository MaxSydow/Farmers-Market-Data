# A Demographic Exploration of Farmers Markets in the US

Udacity Data Science Project - Project 1
Max Sydow


## Overview
Farmers markets appear all over the US, and can provide an alternative to traditional grocery stores for obtaining fresh food and other services from local sources. The aim of this project is to explore accessibility to such markets. Python packages such as Pandas and Numpy were used in a Jupyter notebood to analyze the data sets.  Matplotlib was used for visualization, and Sklearn was used for linear regression.  County level data is examined to answer questions such as:

1.  [Which counties have the highest and lowest concentration of farmers markets?](#FarmersMarkets.ipynb/question-1.)
2.  Does income relate to accessibility to markets?
3.  Is population density related to concentration of farmers markets?
3.  Does higher average income influence the number and type of offerings?


The data used here can be found from Kaggle, and pose the question of accessibility to farmers markets in the US.

Two data sets are used. A farmers market set includes data on farmers markets by county, including market names and food offerings. This data set can be obtained from: 

https://www.ams.usda.gov/local-food-directories/farmersmarkets

The county data set includes more general demographic information like population and incomes, it can be found at:

The data set csv's used here were downloaded directly from the data tab on the Kaggle site.
